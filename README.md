# Meme Project README

## Overview
This project is a simple web page that displays a meme related to programming. It consists of an HTML file that structures the content and a CSS file that styles the page.

## Files
- **index.html**: This is the main file that structures the web page. It contains the content, including the text and the image for the meme.
- **style.css**: This file is responsible for the styling of the HTML content. It defines the layout, fonts, colors, and overall appearance of the web page.

## File Structure


## HTML Structure
- The HTML file includes references to external fonts from Google Fonts for styling the text.
- The page consists of a title, an image, and two text sections:
  - `text1`: Contains the title of the meme ("PROGRAMMERS BE LIKE").
  - `text2`: Contains the caption for the meme.
- The image of the meme is placed inside a div with the class `poster`.

## CSS Styling
- **body**: The background color is set to black to create a contrast with the white text and image border.
- **text1** and **text2**: The text is centered and styled using the "Libre Baskerville" font.
- **poster**: The image container is centered and occupies 50% of the page width, with white borders around the image.
- **img**: The image itself is styled to have a white border and to fit within the container.

## Usage
1. **Run the project**: Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the meme.
2. **Customize**: You can customize the text, image, or styling by editing the `index.html` and `style.css` files.

## Dependencies
- The project uses the "Libre Baskerville" font, which is imported from Google Fonts. Ensure you have an internet connection to load the font.

## Notes
- Ensure that the image path in the `src` attribute of the `<img>` tag is correct relative to the `index.html` file.
- The layout is designed to be responsive and should work well on most screen sizes.
